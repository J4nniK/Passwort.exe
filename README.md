# Passwort.exe

Hi !
Jannik here and I started programming recently and at the moment i m learning C++ and the developing of C++ projects in Visual Studio.

Now to the program itself;

What should the program do:

1. --> Enter Informations into the Console which get Encrypted and saved in a .txt 
2. --> Decrypt the Informations and Output it in the Console
3. --> Access to the .txt with the Console so you can edit the informations
4. --> Set up a Password which gets treated in the same way like above (1-3)
5. --> Setup groups for the Informations
